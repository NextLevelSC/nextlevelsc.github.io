                         <p>This pathway introduces the fundamentals of cloud computing, as well as the AWS cloud computing services. With cloud being a part of everyday life and companies increasingly using cloud solutions to meet their technology needs, it is important to first understand what AWS cloud is and the core concepts, regardless of your background or experience. This pathway will then outline a series of mental models from the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the five pillars of AWS, which are to be considered when working in the cloud. These include: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency and Cost Optimization. Following this, you will learn about the six main benefits of cloud computing, which also relate back to the five pillars and the AWS values of security, reliability and scalability. Finally, there is an opportunity to explore additional learning pathways for free with Amazon Web Services, providing more insight into the AWS Well-Architected Framework, including related best practices and design principles.</p>
